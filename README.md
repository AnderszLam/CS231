Need to restart

## Virtual Environment <br/>

```
cd assignment1
sudo pip install virtualenv                     # This may already be installed
virtualenv -p python3 .env                      # Create a virtual environment (python3)
### Note: you can also use "virtualenv .env" to use your default python (usually python 2.7)
source .env/bin/activate                        # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt                 # Install dependencies
### Work on the assignment for a while ...
source deactivate                               # Exit the virtual environment
```

## Numpy Tips
```
np.reshape ()
> used to reshape an array
> Example: array of dimension 2 x 10 x 10:
  > numpy.reshape(r, shape(5,5,8)) to an array of dimension 5 x 5 x 8
  > OR numpy.reshape (r, shape(5, 5, -1)) will do the same thing
```
```
np.argsort
> x = numpy.array([1.48,1.41,0.0,0.1])
> print x.argsort()
>[2 3 1 0]

2 is the index of 0.0.
3 is the index of 0.1.
1 is the index of 1.41.
0 is the index of 1.48
```
```
np.argmax
> returns indices of the maximum values along axis
> a = array ([[0,1,2],[3,4,5]])
> np.argmax(a)
> 5
```
```
np.bincount
> count number of occurences of each value in array of non-negative ints
> np.bincount(np.arange(5))
> array [(1,1,1,1,1)]
```
```
axis = 1
> Axis of axes along which a sum is performed
> Default (axis=none) sums all the elements of the input array
> If negative --> it counts from the last to the first axis
> It specifies the axis along which the means are computed. By default axis=0. This is consistent with the numpy.mean usage when axis is specified explicitly (in numpy.mean,     axis==None by default, which computes the mean value over the flattened array) , in which axis=0 along the rows (namely, index in pandas), and axis=1 along the columns. For added clarity, one may choose to specify axis='index' (instead of axis=0) or axis='columns' (instead of axis=1).
