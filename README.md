## Virtual Environment <br/>
cd assignment1 <br/>
sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed <br/>
virtualenv -p python3 .env       # Create a virtual environment (python3) <br/>
### Note: you can also use "virtualenv .env" to use your default python (usually python 2.7) <br/>
source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment <br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies <br/>
### Work on the assignment for a while ...<br/>
source deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment <br/>
